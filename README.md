# An intro into CSS and HTML>

## Description

This project was truly a test of basic HTML and CSS, as well as Git functions. It helped me hone new skills, and practice the ones we learned in class.
I will start off by saying initially, I had started working on this code with a repository that wasn't one that I own, and I had a very tough time getting it all set up, so that is one there is only one branch and one commit.
I would appreciate any feedback, as that will only allow me to improve my skills, and help me on future projects.
